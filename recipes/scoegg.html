        <h2><em>Serving</em></h2>
                 Scotch eggs are a common picnic food. In the<em><strong>United Kingdom</strong></em> packaged Scotch eggs are available in supermarkets, 
            corner shops and motorway service stations. Miniature versions are also widely available, sold as "mini scotch eggs" "savoury eggs", 
            "picnic eggs", "party eggs", "snack eggs", "egg bites" or similar. These contain chopped egg or a quail's egg, rather than a whole chicken egg,
            and sometimes contain mayonnaise or chopped bacon.

                In the <em><strong> United States</strong></em>, many "British-style" pubs and eateries serve Scotch eggs, usually served hot with dipping sauces such as ranch dressing, 
            hot sauce, or hot mustard sauce. At the Minnesota State Fair Scotch eggs are served on a stick.[7] Scotch eggs are available at most Renaissance 
            Festivals across the US.
